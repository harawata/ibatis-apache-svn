  <h2>What is iBATIS?</h2>

  <p>The <a title="iBATIS DataMapper framework" href="overview.html">
    iBATIS Data Mapper framework</a> makes it easier to use a database with Java and
    .NET applications. iBATIS couples objects with stored procedures or SQL statements
    using a XML descriptor. Simplicity is the biggest advantage of the iBATIS Data
    Mapper over object relational mapping tools.</p>

  <p>To use the iBATIS Data Mapper, you rely on
    your own objects, XML, and SQL. There is little to learn that you don't already
    know. With the iBATIS Data Mapper, you have the full power of both SQL and stored
    procedures at your fingertips.</p>

<h2>News</h2>

<h3>iBATIS for Java 2.3.0 Released [Status: Beta]</h3>
<p>(December 1, 2006) This release includes several bug fixes and enhancements.
   Additionally, this release offers new support for local caching of prepared statements.
   Caching prepared statements can lead to significant performance improvements
   in many environments.</p>
<p>The Java DAO framework has been deprecated and removed from iBATIS as of release
   2.3.0.  We heartily recommend that you consider using the
   <a href="http://www.springframework.org" target="_blank">Spring Framework</a>
   for all your DAO needs!  Spring offers great support for iBATIS.</p>
<p>The paginated list methods have been deprecated with this release.  The methods were confusing
   to many users and often misused.  We suggest using native database support for paging, 
   or that you use the query methods with skip and max settings.</p>
<p>Release 2.3.0 supercedes the 2.2.0 release which will remain at beta status due to minor
   bugs.  We recommend that all 2.2.0 users upgrade to version 2.3.0.</p>

<h3>iBATIS for Java 2.2.0 Released [Status: Beta]</h3>
<p>(August 16, 2006) This is probably the most significant iBATIS 2.x release in at least a year.  If you
  haven't upgraded in a while, this would be the one to go for. This update includes 25 new minor features
  15 bug fixes and 3 new major features including support for Oracle cursors, multiple result sets and
  private bean properties.  This is also the first release that requires JDK 1.4 (as voted nearly a year ago).
</p>

<h3>iBATIS.NET DataMapper 1.5.1 and DataAccess 1.8.1 General Availability!</h3>
<p>(August 10, 2006) The votes are in and both distributions are now tagged as GA!</p>
<p>This release is primarily an enhancement release to support .NET 2.0 and also bug fix, documentation have been updated.
 iBATIS now supports all essential features of .NET 2.0 (generics, nullable types), see change log for more information.

<h3>Fall is a great time for a conference!</h3>
 <p>(Jul 30, 2006) We've just added a new event to the calendar.  <b>Calgary in September:</b> Clinton will be
   presenting on all things iBATIS, Ajax, Agile and ...erm, Ruby.  Not that he's a buzzword chaser or
   anything.  </p>
<p><a href="events.html">See the Events Calendar for more.</a></p>

<h3>RBatis - iBATIS for Ruby has been released!</h3>
 <p>(Jul 30, 2006) As promised almost exactly one year ago...iBATIS for Ruby is now here. Jon Tirsen
   has joined the team and RBatis is ready to roll with a plug-in for Rails of course. You can see
   the permanent link in the Path to iBATIS on the left, but don't waste time moving your mouse....</p>
<p><a href="docs/ruby">Check it out!</a></p>

<h3>DTDs @ iBATIS.com - The Deed has been done</h3>
 <p>(Jul 30, 2006) The DTDs hosted at iBATIS.com have been permanently removed. The multiple warnings
 went starting with a broadcast announcement to the mailing lists and a permanent space on the homepage.
 With over 1.5 million hits to the DTD per month, it was time to move the burden over to the Apache servers.  ;-)
 If you're a year behind on your email and using an old version of iBATIS, and you're wondering why
 your application won't start anymore...try changing the DOCTYPE of your XML files to the following.</p>

<pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE sqlMapConfig <br/>
          PUBLIC "-//ibatis.apache.org//DTD SQL Map Config 2.0//EN" <br/>
          "http://ibatis.apache.org/dtd/sql-map-config-2.dtd"&gt;
</pre>
