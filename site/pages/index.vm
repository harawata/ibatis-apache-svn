  <h2>What is iBATIS?</h2>

  <p>The <a title="iBATIS DataMapper framework" href="overview.html">
    iBATIS Data Mapper framework</a> makes it easier to use a database with Java and
    .NET applications. iBATIS couples objects with stored procedures or SQL statements
    using a XML descriptor. Simplicity is the biggest advantage of the iBATIS Data
    Mapper over object relational mapping tools.</p>

  <p>To use the iBATIS Data Mapper, you rely on
    your own objects, XML, and SQL. There is little to learn that you don't already
    know. With the iBATIS Data Mapper, you have the full power of both SQL and stored
    procedures at your fingertips.</p>

<h3>iBATIS 2.3.2 Beta and German Docs</h3>
<p>(Apr 22, 2008) I've released a small update which corrects a few logistical issues with the 2.3.1 deploy.  It's a very minor release, but this will be the next GA version if all goes well.  Thus 2.3.1 will never be GA, so get this one.  In addition to that, <b>Axel Leucht</b> has contributed documentation in German.  So now all of my co-workers at Arvato can read about iBATIS too!  ;-)   Thanks Axel.  
<p><b><a href="javadownloads.cgi">So go get the 2.3.2 Beta from the Java downloads page now!</a></b></p>

<h3>Abator Renamed to iBATOR</h3>
<p>(April 14, 2008) Due to a trade registration dispute, Abator is renamed to iBATOR.  iBATOR is
  currently a work in progress, but an initial code drop has been added to SVN.  See the 
  <a href="ibator.html">new iBATOR page</a> for more information.
</p>

<h3>iBATIS 2.3.1 Beta Available</h3>
<p>(March 25, 2008) This is a long overdue maintenance release.  Fixes about 20 issues and includes two significant improvements.  The first is the elimination of the Throttle.  Originally included to artificially constrain threads, requests, and transactions to improve performance on certain infrastructure.  It's not as much of an issue anymore and today the Throttle caused more problems than it solved.  So bye-bye.  :-)  The only real impact you'll see is that the maxSessions/maxTransactions/maxRequests no longer have any effect whatsoever.  The other new change is built-in support for enums out of the box!  It's currently a Beta release as per our process.  But if all goes well over the next week or two, we'll vote to promote it to GA.  The best thing you can do is test it out for us!

<h3>Abator 1.1 Available</h3>
<p>(March 20, 2008) Abator version 1.1 is available.  This version has quite a few minor enhancements,
 two major enhancements (two new methods can be generated), and a few bug fixes.  Check it out
 <a href="abator.html">here</a>.

<h3>It's quiet, too quiet!</h3>
 <p>(March 10, 2008) Yes, we're alive.  I felt the need to update the homepage since it's been a while(!).  All of the activity is on the mailing list these days,
 and we haven't had a major release in a while.  That's all about to change.  The iBATIS 3.0 whiteboard has been up for a while and I think the ideas are sound.  We've had a lot
 of great feedback and it's time to get to work.  iBATIS will have it's sixth birthday on July 1st, 2008.  I'd like to suggest that we have a Beta 
 version of iBATIS 3.0 out by that day.  Don't get too excited!  If you're currently using 2.0, you likely will be for a long time (heck, Larry still uses 1.x).  So, we'll 
 continue to support it for a long time as well.  iBATIS 3.0 will be the biggest change to the framework since the original concept.  While we're hoping to hold
 true to some of the philosophies that have made iBATIS popular, it will look very different.  Check out the iBATIS 3.0 whiteboard for more.</p>

<h3>iBATIS 3.0 Design Whiteboard</h3>
 <p>(June 12, 2007) Next month, on July 1st iBATIS will officially be 5 years old, and 2.0 alone
   will be 3 years long in the tooth.  It's time, or perhaps overdue that we start designing and
   implementing the third version.  A lot has changed in 5 years, many best practices are now simply
   "old practices".  It's time to start from scratch.  Clinton's thoughts are up. This is your chance to
   influence the future direction of iBATIS.</p>

<h3>Java Documentation in 7 languages including Japanese</h3>
 <p>(June 12, 2007) Thanks to the contributions from our iBATIS community, we now have
 documentation in 7 languages!  The most recent addition is Japanese, which joins Chinese,
 Korean, Italian, Spanish, French and English.</p>
