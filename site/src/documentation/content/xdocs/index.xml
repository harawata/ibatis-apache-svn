		  <title>Infrastructure Migration Complete!</title>
		  <p>
		  (12 Feb 2005) Well, it took a little longer than expected, but we've successfully migrated the entire
       iBATIS project to Apache infrastructure. Now that we have our SVN repository again, I've spent most of the day clearing
       out some overdue JIRA issues. I'll be doing a maintenance release (2.0.9b) within a day or two in order to
       keep you all up and running. As planned, 2.1 will be a feature release with some cool stuff. You can also browse
       our repository or even checkout the source yourself from the public SVN and build any time you like.
      </p>
