<h1>Abator for Eclipse Quick Start Guide</h1>
<p>To get up and running quickly with Abator in the Eclipse environment, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create an Abator configuration file:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>File&gt;New&gt;Abator for iBATIS Configuration File</li>
      <li>Specify the location of the file, and the name of the file (defaults to abatorConfig.xml)</li>
      <li>Finish the wizard</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Fill out the configuration file appropriately.  At a minimum, you must specify:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>jdbcConnection information to specify how to connect to the target database</li>
      <li>A target package, and target project for the javaModelGenerator</li>
      <li>A target package, and target project for the sqlMapGenerator</li>
      <li>A target package, target project, and type for the daoGenerator (or you can remove the
          daoGenerator element if you don't wish to generate DAOs)</li>
      <li>At least one database table</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Save the file</li>
  <li>Right click on the configuration file in Eclipse's navigator, or package explorer, view and take the
      menu option to "Generate iBATIS Artifacts"</li>
</ol>
<p>Important things to note:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Abator will not overwrite any custom changes you make to the objects it generates.  You can
      run it over and over again without fear of losing custom changes.</li>
  <li>Abator does supply a custom editor for Abator configuration files, but it is very low
      function.  The editor is associated with all XML files that are Abator configuration
      files.
      If you are using RAD/RSA, then
      the included XML editor is much more useful.  Or if you use some other XML plug-in (like
      XML Buddy),
      it is likely that the editor supplied with the plug-in will be more useful.</li>
</ol>
