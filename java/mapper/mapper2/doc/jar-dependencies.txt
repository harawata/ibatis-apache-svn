JAR File Dependencies
---------------------

iBATIS 2.0 has generally few dependencies.  If you're running JDK 1.4, then
the only real dependency is on the Jakarta Commons Logging framework.  The
optional JAR file libraries are organized into a package structure found in
/lib/optional and are categorized by function.

  * If you're running less than JDK 1.4 and if your app server also
    doesn't already supply the following, then you will need these
    optional JAR packages:

      /lib/optional/jdbc
      /lib/optional/jta
      /lib/optional/xml

All remaining libraries and JAR files are completely optional. Here's
a summary of those libraries and when you need to use them.

  * If you want to use bytecode enhancement with CGLIB 2.0 you'll need:

      /lib/optional/enhancement

  * If you want to use the Jakarta DBCP connection pool you'll need:

      /lib/optional/dbcp

  * If you want to use OSCache you'll need:

      /lib/optional/caching

  * If you want to use log4j logging you'll need:

      /lib/optional/logging

  * If you want to use legacy (1.x) DAO framework or SQL Map APIs you'll need:

      /lib/optional/compatibility

That's it!
