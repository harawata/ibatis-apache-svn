JAR File Dependencies
---------------------

iBATIS 2.0 has very few dependencies.  If you're running JDK 1.4, then
the only real dependency is on the Jakarta Commons Logging framework included in
the /lib directory.

  * If you're running less than JDK 1.4 and if your app server also
    doesn't already supply the following, then you may need these:    

      JDBC 2.0 Extensions    (http://java.sun.com/products/jdbc/download.html)
      JTA 1.0.1a             (http://java.sun.com/products/jta/)
      Xerces 2.4.0           (http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/)

All remaining libraries and JAR files are completely optional. Here's
a summary of those libraries and when you need to use them.  The versions
listed here are simply the version tested.  Higher versions may or may not 
work.

  * If you want to use bytecode enhancement for advanced lazy loading:

      CGLIB 2.0              (http://cglib.sf.net)

  * If you want to use the Jakarta DBCP connection pool you'll need:

      DBCP 1.1               (http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/dbcp/)

  * If you want to use distributed caching you'll need:

      OSCache 2.0.1          (http://www.opensymphony.com/oscache/)

  * If you want to use advanced logging you'll need:

      Log4J 1.2.8            (http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/)

  * If you want to use legacy (1.x) DAO framework or SQL Map APIs you'll need:

      iBATIS DAO 1.3.1       (http://sourceforge.net/projects/ibatisdb/)

That's it!
