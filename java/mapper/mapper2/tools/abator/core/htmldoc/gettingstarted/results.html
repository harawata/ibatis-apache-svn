  <title>Using the Abator Generated Objects</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Using the Abator Generated Objects</h1>
<p>Abator generates three types of objects:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="generatedobjects/sqlmap.html">SQL Map Files</a></li>
  <li><a href="generatedobjects/javamodel.html">Java Model Classes</a></li>
  <li><a href="generatedobjects/javadao.html">Java DAO Classes (optional)</a></li>
</ol>
  
<p>The individual pages describe these objects, and their usage.</p>
<p>One important thing to remember
is that Abator can be, and probably will be, run many times during the development of a project.  Abator
will always overwrite any methods, fields, or XML elements that it has created.  But Abator WILL NOT
overwrite any additions you have made to these files.  So you can, and often will, make changes
the the generated objects without fear of losing those changes on subsequent runs of Abator.</p>
