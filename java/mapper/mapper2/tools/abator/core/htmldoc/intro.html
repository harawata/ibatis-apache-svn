<h1>Introduction to Abator</h1>
<p><b>Abator:</b> <i>One who abates a nuisance.</i>
<font size="-2">(<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=abator">
http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=abator</a>)</font></p>

<p>Abator is a code generator for <a href="http://ibatis.apache.org">iBATIS</a>.
 Abator will introspect a database
 table (or many tables) and will generate iBATIS artifacts that can be used to
 access the table(s).  This lessens the initial nuisance of setting up objects and configuration
 files to interact with database tables.  Abator seeks to make a major impact on the large
percentage of database operations that are simple CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete).  You will
 still need to hand code SQL and objects for custom queries, or stored procedures.
</p>
<p>Abator will generate:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Java POJOs that match the table structure including:
    <ul>
      <li>a class to match the primary key of the table (if there is a primary key)</li>
      <li>a class to match the non-primary key fields of the table (except BLOB fields)</li>
      <li>a class to include the BLOB fields of a table (if the table has BLOB fields)</li>
      <li>a class to enable "Query By Example" functionality</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is an inheritance relationship between these classes as appropriate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>iBATIS Compatible SQL Map XML Files.  Abator generates SQL for simple
   CRUD functions on each table in a configuration.  The generated SQL
   statements include:
    <ul>
      <li>insert</li>
      <li>update by primary key</li>
      <li>delete by primary key</li>
      <li>delete by example (using a "query by example" strategy)</li>
      <li>select by primary key</li>
      <li>select by example (using a "query by example" strategy)</li>
    </ul>
   <p>There are different variations of these statements depending on the
   structure of the table (e.g. - if the table doesn't have a primary key,
   then Abator will not generate an update by primary key function, etc.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>DAO interface and implementation classes that make appropriate use of the
    above objects.  The generation of DAO classes is optional.  Abator will
    generate DAOs of the following types:
    <ul>
      <li>DAOs that conform to the iBATIS DAO Framework (an optional part of iBATIS)</li>
      <li>DAOs that conform to the SpringFramework</li>
      <li>DAOs that only use the iBATIS SQL mapping API.  These DAOs can be
          generated in two varieties: supplying the SqlMapClient through
          either constructor or setter injection.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Abator is designed to run well in an iterative development environment, and
  Abator can even be included as an Ant task in a continuous build environment.
  Important things to note when running Abator iteratively include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Abator will automatically merge XML files if there is an existing file
      with the same name as the newly generated XML file.  Abator will not overwrite
      any custom changes you make to the XML files it generates.
      You can run it over and over again without fear of losing custom changes to you XML.
      Abator will replace any XML elements that were generated in a previous run.
      </li>
  <li>Abator will not merge Java files, it can either overwrite existing files
      or save newly generated files with a different unique name.  If you make changes
      to the generated Java files and run Abator iteratively you will have to
      merge the changes by hand.  When run as an <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>
      plugin, then Abator can automatically merge Java files.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>Abator has no dependencies beyond the JRE.  Abator does require JRE 1.4 or
above.  Abator also requires that the JDBC driver implements the
DatabaseMetaData interface, especially the "getColumns" and "getPrimaryKeys"
methods.</p>

<h2>Support</h2>
<p>Support for Abator is provided through the iBATIS user mailing list.  Mail
questions or bug reports to:</p>
