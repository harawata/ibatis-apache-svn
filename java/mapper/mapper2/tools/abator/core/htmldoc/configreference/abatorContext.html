<h1>The &lt;abatorContext&gt; Element</h1>
<p>The &lt;abatorContext&gt; element is used to specify the environment for
generating a set of objects.  Child elements are used to specify the database
to connect to, the type of objects to generate, and the tables to introspect.
Multiple &lt;abatorContext&gt; elements can be listed inside an
<a href="abatorConfiguration.html">&lt;abatorConfiguration&gt;</a>
element to allow generating objects from different
databases, or with different generation parameters, in the same run of Abator.</p>

      This property is used to select different sets of code generators,

      The property supports these values:

          <td><i>This is the default value</i>
              <br/>This set of code generators generate objects that are compatible
            with all iBATIS versions and all levels of Java 2.  The "by example"
            methods in these generated objects are somewhat limited - those
            methods are much more functional with the other generators.  These are
            the original code generators shipped with early versions of Abator.
            <b>We strongly recommend that you choose one of the other generator sets.</b>
            This set remains the default for backward compatibility reasons, but may be
            removed in some future version of Abator.</td>
