<h1>What's New in Abator</h1>
<p>This page lists new, or recent, changes to Abator.</p>

<h2>Generator Sets</h2>
<p>Version 0.7.0 introduces the concept of generator sets.  A generator set is a set of
code generators (SQL Map Generator, Java Model Generator, DAO Generator).  Abator now
ships three different generator sets.  The generated code from these three
generator sets is slightly different, and the use of the generated objects is slightly
different too.  The concepts are exactly the same.</p>
<p>The three generator sets shipped with Abator are as follows:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Legacy</dt>
  <dd>This generator set generates code that is the same as previous versions of
      Abator.  There are some limitations with the generator set and we strongly
      recommend that you choose one of the other sets.  However, this set remains
      the default for now.  <b>This generator set will likely be removed in a future
      version of Abator.</b></dd>
  <dt>Java2</dt>
  <dd>This generator set generates code that is compatible with iBATIS versions 2.2.0 and
      higher.  In that version of iBATIS a longstanding bug with nested iterate
      tags was fixed.  With this new support in iBATIS, Abator can generate
      much more functional SQL WHERE clauses.  It is now possible to generate
      virtually unlimited SQL WHERE clauses with Abator generated code (including "IN"
      clauses).  <b>This generator set will likely become the default set in a
      future version of Abator.</b></dd>
  <dt>Java5</dt>
  <dd>This generator set has the same capabilities as the Java2 generator set with the
      added feature of generating code that is JSE 5.0 compliant using parameterized
      types and annotations.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Important:</b> code generated with the Java2 or Java5 generator sets is not 100%
compatible with code generated with the Legacy set - especially in the use of the
"byExample" methods.  Also note that the "byExample" methods in these generator sets rely
on iBATIS dynamic SQL support that is missing in versions prior to iBATIS version 2.2.0.</p>
<p>A generator set is selected with the <code>generatorSet</code> attribute of the
<code>&lt;abatorContext&gt;</code> element.  See the
<a href="configreference/abatorContext.html">&lt;abatorContext&gt;</a> reference page for
more information.</p>
