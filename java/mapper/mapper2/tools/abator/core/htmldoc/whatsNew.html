<h1>What's New in Abator</h1>
<h2>Generator Sets (Version 0.7.0)</h2>
<p>A generator set is a set of
code generators (SQL Map Generator, Java Model Generator, DAO Generator, and Java Type Resolver).
Abator now ships three different generator sets.  The generated code from these three
generator sets is slightly different, and the use of the generated objects is slightly
different too.  The concepts are exactly the same.  With the newer generator sets, the
"by example" methods have been vastly improved.  It is now possible to generate
<b>virtually any</b> WHERE clause (including IN and BETWEEN predicates).  Lastly, the new
generator sets generate much more concise code - the DAOs and SQL Maps are of
normal size, and there are no extraneous methods.  The example class in the new generator
sets encapsulates all the function needed to generate dynamic queries.</p>
<p>The three generator sets shipped with Abator are as follows:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Legacy</dt>
  <dd>This generator set generates code that is the same as previous versions of
      Abator.  There are some limitations with this generator set and we strongly
      recommend that you choose one of the other sets.  However, this set remains
      the default for now.  <b>This generator set will likely be removed in a future
      version of Abator.</b></dd>
  <dt>Java2</dt>
  <dd>This generator set generates code that is compatible with iBATIS versions 2.2.0 and
      higher.  With this generator set the "by example" methods are much more powerful
      than in the legacy set.  It is now possible to generate
      virtually unlimited SQL WHERE clauses with Abator generated code (including "IN"
      and "BETWEEN" clauses).  <b>This generator set will likely become the default set in a
      future version of Abator.</b></dd>
  <dt>Java5</dt>
  <dd>This generator set has the same capabilities as the Java2 generator set with the
      added feature of generating code that is JSE 5.0 compliant using parameterized
      types and annotations.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Important:</b> code generated with the Java2 or Java5 generator sets is not 100%
compatible with code generated with the Legacy set - especially in the use of the
"by example" methods.  Also note that the "by example" methods in these generator sets rely
on iBATIS dynamic SQL support that is missing in iBATIS versions prior to version 2.2.0.</p>
<p>A generator set is selected with the <code>generatorSet</code> attribute of the
<code>&lt;abatorContext&gt;</code> element.  See the
<a href="configreference/abatorContext.html">&lt;abatorContext&gt;</a> reference page for
more information.</p>

<p>Use of the example classes is different with the different generator sets.  See the
<a href="generatedobjects/exampleClassUsage.html">Example Class Usage</a> page for more
information.</a>
<h2>Version 0.7.0 Miscellaneous Changes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Added the ability to specify a table alias.  This aids in reuse of generated
    SQL map elements.  See the <a href="configreference/table.html">&lt;table&gt;</a>
    reference page for more information.</li>
  <li>Fixed the XML file merger so that extraneous blank lines at the end of the
      file are removed.</li>
  <li>Added the ability to specify a type handler for table columns.
    See the <a href="configreference/columnOverride.html">&lt;columnOverride&gt;</a>
    reference page for more information.</li>
  <li>Added the ability to specify the visibility of the DAO "by example" methods.
    This allows you to make the methods private for internal use only.
    See the <a href="configreference/daoGenerator.html">&lt;daoGenerator&gt;</a>
    reference page for more information.</li>
  <li>Added the ability to override the naming convention for DAO method names.
    See the <a href="configreference/daoGenerator.html">&lt;daoGenerator&gt;</a>
    reference page for more information.</li>
</ul>
