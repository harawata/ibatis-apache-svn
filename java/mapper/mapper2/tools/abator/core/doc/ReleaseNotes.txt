-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.6.2:
1. Added support for specifying rootClass for the model objects and
   rootInterface for the DAO interface
2. Refactored code generation rules and added lots of documentation for
   the rules (see new org.apache.ibatis.abator.internal.rules package)
3. Ensure that property names are valid for iBATIS even if the user
   specifies "useActualColumnNames"
4. Added JDBC types for DATE and TIME fields to the mapping properties
   in the by example where clause fragment
5. Externalized all message strings
6. Abator will now survive if the JDBC driver does not support the
   getPrimaryKeys() function - but with reduced function

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.6.1:
1. Added support for running Abator from the command line
2. Fixed bug: NPE when <generatedKey> specifies an unknown column
3. Fixed bug: getExampleParms method in generated DAO can grow so enormous
   that it can't be compiled.  The fix is to break it into smaller methods.
4. Implemented an "iBATIS-like" Ant build

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.6.0:
1. Restructured as a standalone JAR file with no Eclipse dependencies
2. Added an Ant task
3. Added support for wrapping primitive data types in the "by example" methods
4. Removed dependency on JDOM
5. Greatly improved extensibility of the default code generators
6. Added support for disovering the case sensitivity of the database in regard
   to table names.
