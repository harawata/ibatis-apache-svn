<h1>Using the Eclipse User Interface for Abator</h1>
<p>See the <a href="quickstart.html">Quickstart Guide</a> for a quick start!</p>
<p>The Abator user interface consists of these elements</p>
<ul>
  <li>A custom editor for Abator configuration files</li>
  <li>A new file wizard for creating configuration files</li>
  <li>An action to run Abator</li>
</ul>

<h2>Configuration File Editor</h2>
<p>The configuration file editor is a low function editor.  It only provides
   enough functionality to be somewhat better than a plain text editor (like some color
   syntax highlighting).
   If you have some better XML file editor available in your environment, it will likely be
   a better than this editor.  The editor is useful in a very basic Eclipse installation
   which has no other XML editor.</p>

<p>The editor is automatically associated with XML files that are proper Abator
   configuration files.  </p>

<h2>New Configuration File Wizard</h2>
<p>The new configuration file wizard will create a new XML file with a basic outline
of a configuration file for Abator.  You do not need to use this wizard, but it is useful
for setting up a new configuration file.</p>

<p>You can access the wizard from the menu: "File&gt;New&gt;Abator for iBATIS Configuration File"</p>

<h2>Run Abator Action</h2>
<p>The run Abator action is the heart of the Eclipse user interface.  The plug-in will
   add a popup menu option called "Generate iBATIS Artifacts" to any XML file that has the
   root element of "abatorConfiguration".  To run Abator, right click on an Abator
   configuration file in any view and select the menu option.</p>
