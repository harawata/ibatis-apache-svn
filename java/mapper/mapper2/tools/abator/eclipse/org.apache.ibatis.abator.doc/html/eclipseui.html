<h1>Using the Eclipse User Interface for Abator</h1>
<p>See the <a href="quickstart.html">Quickstart Guide</a> for a quick start!</p>
<p>The Abator user interface consists of these elements</p>
<ul>
  <li>A custom editor for Abator configuration files</li>
  <li>A new file wizard for creating configuration files</li>
  <li>An action to run Abator</li>
  <li>An Eclipse Integrated Ant Task</li>
</ul>

<h2>Configuration File Editor</h2>
<p>The configuration file editor is a low function editor.  In this release, it only provides
   enough functionality to be somewhat better than a plain text editor (like some color
   syntax highlighting).  In future releases we hope to add more function to this editor.
   If you have some better XML file editor available in your environment, it will likely be
   a better than this editor.  The editor is useful in a very basic Eclipse installation
   which has no other XML editor.</p>

<p>The editor is automatically associated with files named "abatorConfig.xml".  If you
   are using a very basic Eclipse install, you might consider associating this editor
   with any XML file.  In the Eclipse 3.1 version of the plug-in, we will associate the
   editor with any Abator configuration file, regardless of the file name.</p>

<h2>New Configuration File Wizard</h2>
<p>The new configuration file wizard will create a new XML file with a basic outline
of a configuration file for Abator.  You do not need to use this wizard, but it is useful
for setting up a new configuration file.</p>

<p>You can access the wizard from the menu: "File&gt;New&gt;Abator for iBATIS Configuration File"</p>

<h2>Run Abator Action</h2>
<p>The run Abator action is the heart of the Eclipse user interface.  The plug-in will
   add a popup menu option called "Generate iBATIS Artifacts" to any XML file that has the
   root element of "abatorConfiguration".  To run Abator, right click on an Abator
   configuration file in any view and select the menu option.</p>

<h2>Integrated Ant Task</h2>
<p>The Abator plug-in declares an Ant task for use within the Eclipse JRE.  The
  task is called "abator.generate".  Here is en example Ant build file:</p>

<pre>
&lt;project default="runAbator"&gt;
  &lt;target name="runAbator"&gt;
    &lt;eclipse.convertPath resourcepath="AbatorTest/src/config/abatorConfig.xml"
                         property="thePath"/&gt;
    &lt;abator.generate configfile="${thePath}" /&gt;
  &lt;/target>
&lt;/project>
</pre>
<p>This file uses the Eclipse supplied "eclipse.convertPath" task to calculate the
 actual path of the configuration file.  Then we use the "abator.generate" task to
 run Abator.  The only thing to remember when running this from Eclipse interactively
 is that the Ant launch must be setup to run in the same JRE as the workspace.
 This setting is a standard configuration setting for running Ant in Eclipse.
