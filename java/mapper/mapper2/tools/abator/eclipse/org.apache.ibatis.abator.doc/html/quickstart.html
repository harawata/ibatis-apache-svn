<h1>Abator Quick Start Guide</h1>
<p>To get up and running quickly with Abator, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create an Abator configuration file:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>File&gt;New&gt;Abator for iBATIS Configuration File</li>
      <li>Specify the location of the file, and the name of the file (defaults to abatorConfig.xml)</li>
      <li>Finish the wizard</li>
    </ol>
  <li>Fill out the configuration file appropriately.  At a minimum, you must specify:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>jdbcConnection information to specify how to connect to the target database</li>
      <li>A target package, and target project for the javaModelGenerator</li>
      <li>A target package, and target project for the sqlMapGenerator</li>
      <li>A target package, target project, and type for the daoGenerator (or you can remove the
          daoGenerator element if you don't wish to generate DAOs)</li>
      <li>At least one database table</li>
    </ol>
  <li>Save the file</li>
  <li>Right click on the configuration file in Eclipse's navigator, or package explorer, view and take the
      menu option to "Generate iBATIS Artifacts"</li>
</ol>
<p>Important things to note:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Abator will not overwrite any custom changes you make to the objects it generates.  You can
      run it over and over again without fear of losing custom changes.</li>
  <li>Currently, the configuration options are most fully documented in the DTD.  Look there for
      any questions.</li>
  <li>Abator does supply a custom editor for Abator configuration files, but it is very low
      function and currently only associated with files named "abatorConfig.xml".  With
      Eclipse 3.1, the editor will be more full function.  If you are using RAD/RSA, then
      the included XML editor is much more useful.  Or if you use some other XML plugin (like 
      XML Buddy),
      it it likely that the editor supplied with the plugin will be more useful.</li>
  <li>The generated Java classes will not, and should not, contain any JDK 5.0 features.  The next 
      version of Abator will support Eclipse 3.1 and JDK 5.0.  Until that time, do not add any JDK
      5.0 features to the generated Java classes - Abator will likely fail if you do.</li>
</ol>
