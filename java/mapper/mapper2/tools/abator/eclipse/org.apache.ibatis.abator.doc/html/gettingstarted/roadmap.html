<h1>Abator Roadmap</h1>
<p>The following are enhancements that we would like to make to Abator:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A better configuration file editor for Eclipse</li>
  <li>A better file association mapping for Eclipse (will be accomplished in the Eclipse 3.1
      version)</li>
  <li>Ability to provide custom generator objects in the Eclipse environment (will be accomplished
      in the Eclipse 3.1 version).  Eclipse 3.0 does not support robust enough classpath management
      for plugins to make this possible without major gyrations - this is the same issue that the
      Hibernate folks faced with their tooling.</li>
  <li>Update By Example Method (???)</li>
  <li>Optional support for JDK 5.0 generics on the appropriate methods (will be accomplished in the Eclipse 3.1
      version)</li>
  <li>Better "by example" functionality - could be improved if the iBATIS <code>iterate</code> tag were
      more functional.</li>
  <li>Improve/complete the JavaDoc!</li>
</ul>
<p>Your suggestions are welcome too!</p>
