Core:

  1.2

    1. Write page explaining how to use the GENERIC DAOs
    2. Make a more general method of dealing with the classpath
    3. Take a look at the Java API - looks a little cumbersome to run
    4. The mergers should delete the old abator stuff also
       
  Future

    1. Change the base API to allow specifying a connection at
       runtime, rather than requiring a connection in the 
       XML config.

    2. Write a plugin mechanism for the base code - to be able to add
       user written plugins.  Good example would be a Spring validator
       generator plugin, or a plugin that generates SqlMapConfig fragments.

    3. Refactoring: Make a class for each type of method to be generated
    
    4. Relationships?

Eclipse:

  1.2
  
    1. Rename to iBATOR

    2. Write a launch configuration for the plugin to allow better
       control of the class path.
       
    3. Get rid of the "Generate iBATIS Artifacts" popup menu - should
       only run with a launch configuration or with Ant.
