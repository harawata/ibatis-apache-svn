Core:

  1.2

    1. Write page explaining how to use the GENERIC DAOs
    2. Rename to iBATOR
    3. Deal with UnsupportedDataTypeException better
    4. Make a more general method of dealing with the classpath
    5. Switch to Java 5.0
    6. Take a look at the Java API - looks a little cumbersome to run
    7. The mergers should delete the old abator stuff also
    8. Remove the "legacy" generators
    9. Remove all custom classloading.  Delegate soley to the JRE or
       the eclipse launch configuration
       
  Future

    1. Change the base API to allow specifying a connection at
       runtime, rather than requiring a connection in the 
       XML config.

    2. Write a plugin mechanism for the base code - to be able to add
       user written plugins.  Good example would be a Spring validator
       generator plugin, or a plugin that generates SqlMapConfig fragments.

    3. Refactoring: Make a class for each type of method to be generated
    
    4. Relationships?

Eclipse:

  1.2
  
    1. Rename to iBATOR

    2. Write a launch configuration for the plugin to allow better
       control of the class path.
       
    3. Get rid of the "Generate iBATIS Artifacts" popup menu - should
       only run with a launch configuration or with Ant.
