Core:

  1.2

    1. Write page explaining how to use the GENERIC DAOs

    3. Document plugins - plugin lifecycle
       
  Future

    1. Change the base API to allow specifying a connection at
       runtime, rather than requiring a connection in the 
       XML config.

    2. Refactoring: Make a class for each type of method to be generated
    
    3. Relationships?

Eclipse:

  1.2
  
    1. Rename to ibator

    2. Write a launch configuration for the plugin to allow better
       control of the class path.
       
    3. Get rid of the "Generate iBATIS Artifacts" popup menu - should
       only run with a launch configuration or with Ant.
