Releasing Ibator:

1. Increment the version number of Ibator in version.properties

2. Build and test the base Ibator (make sure to use JDK 5.0)

3. Build the new version of the Eclipse feature:
  - Copy new ibator.jar and ibator-src.zip into the core plugin 
  - Increment the version number of the feature
  - Increment the version number of any plugin that has changed
  - Build the doc
  - Add the new version of the feature to site.xml in the IbatorUpdateSite
    project
  - Build the update site (just the new version, not build all)
  - Delete the files artifacts.xml and content.xml generated by the
    site builder (these files do not properly categorize the features.
    See Eclipse bug 227675 for a possible solution in release 3.5)

    site build process
