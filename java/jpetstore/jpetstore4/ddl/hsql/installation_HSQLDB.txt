Installation of HSQLDB for use with JPetstore 3
===============================================

The following applies for release 3.1.0-b (referenced as "JP3")

To integrate HSQLDB with JP3, do this:

1. HSQLDB jar file
------------------
Get HSQLDB.jar and copy it into the WEB-INF/lib-directory under the src-directory

2. Database definition
----------------------
Copy the files jpetstore-hsqldb-schema.sql and jpetstore-hsqldb-dataload.sql
into the directory ddl/hsqldb. the subdirectory hsqldb has to be created first!

3. Create database and fill it
------------------------------
With the tool of your choice, run both sql scripts given in step 2 against the
HSQLDB database. First the jpetstore-hsqldb-schema.sql and then the other one.
Be sure to use a file-based storage, not the in-memory variant also possible
with HSQLDB!

4. Change petstore.properties
-----------------------------
Be sure to have the following properties set correctly in the petstore.properties
file:
--
driver=org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
url=jdbc:hsqldb:D:/tmp/jpetstore
username=sa
password=
--
Adapt the path and file name for property "SimpleUrl" to fit your configuration.

5. Change sequence.xml
----------------------
Search for "for update" and delete it.

6. Build JP3
------------
Now you can build JP3 and deploy it.



Please notice that it is not necessary to start up HSQLDB! This is done by the
application itself thru the given HSQLDB.jar file.
