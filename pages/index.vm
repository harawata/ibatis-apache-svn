    <h2>What is iBATIS?</h2>

    <p>The <a title="iBATIS DataMapper framework" href="datamapper.html">
    iBATIS Data Mapper framework</a> makes it easier to use a database with Java and
    .NET applications. iBATIS couples objects with stored procedures or SQL statements
    using a XML descriptor. Simplicity is the biggest advantage of the iBATIS Data
    Mapper over object relational mapping tools.</p>

    <p>To use the iBATIS Data Mapper, you rely on
    your own objects, XML, and SQL. There is little to learn that you don't already
    know. With the iBATIS Data Mapper, you have the full power of both SQL and stored
    procedures at your fingertips.</p>

    <h2>News</h2>

      <h3>iBATIS for Java 2.1.5 Released</h3>
      <p>(July 17, 2005) We've released a maintenance release, with a few bonuses as well.  The most
      notable changes are: 1) iBATIS no longer depends on commons logging, and 2) the entity resolvers
      are now smarter so that they should resolve DTDs without the network as long as you have
      a correct XML DOCTYPE header.  In addition to that, we've fixed a bunch of bugs including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed IBATIS-136 groupBy not carried forward to extended result maps</li>
        <li>Fixed IBATIS-139 discriminator being applied to too many result maps (thanks Sven)</li>
        <li>Fixed IBATIS-152, 149, 116 null result sets now handled properly by JDBC logging classes (thanks Sven)</li>
        <li>Fixed IBATIS-146 consumes additional result sets before retrieving output params (JTDS fix)</li>
        <li>Fixed IBATIS-130 parameter maps don't allow for complete TypeHandler implementations</li>
        <li>Fixed IBATIS-148 fixed dynamic SQL in iterates</li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="downloads.html">Get iBATIS 2.1.5 from the Downloads page.</a><br/>
