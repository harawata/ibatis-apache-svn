  <h2>What is iBATIS?</h2>

  <p>The <a title="iBATIS DataMapper framework" href="overview.html">
    iBATIS Data Mapper framework</a> makes it easier to use a database with Java and
    .NET applications. iBATIS couples objects with stored procedures or SQL statements
    using a XML descriptor. Simplicity is the biggest advantage of the iBATIS Data
    Mapper over object relational mapping tools.</p>

  <p>To use the iBATIS Data Mapper, you rely on
    your own objects, XML, and SQL. There is little to learn that you don't already
    know. With the iBATIS Data Mapper, you have the full power of both SQL and stored
    procedures at your fingertips.</p>

  <h2>News</h2>

  <h3>iBATIS in Action Released</h3>
  <p>(January 26, 2007) A book for iBATIS?  No way!  Yes way.  The book is here.
  This is the first edition, targeting primarily the Java platform.  But it's
  definitely useful for .NET and even Ruby users, even if only to understand
  the concepts and and ideas behind iBATIS.  Everything else is just syntax.  Some people
  may wonder if we're just trying to make money by selling documentation (sounds
  familiar to some no doubt).  But trust us, writing technical books is NO way
  to make money!  We did this for you, so you'd have a definitive guide to read
  from instead of wading through various internet resources. I think we're more
  worried about the Amazon.com comments than the sales... ;-)  I (Clinton) really
  want to say what a fantastic experience it was to work with Brandon and Larry
  on this project.  You guys did a fantastic job.</p>

  <h3>DAO Deprecated and Made Available Separately</h3>
  <p>(January 26, 2007) This is a little late notice, but iBATIS for Java 2.3 has enough
  votes to go GA now, so I figured it would be good to note here.  The DAO
  framework has indeed been deprecated.  Deprecated doesn't mean dead.  Many people
  can and will continue to use it.  In fact, it will be a bit cleaner because
  it's made available separately so you can feel more comfortable changing it if you
  need to.  Feel free to take the code and make it your own.  Or just use it as
  is until it gets too old (it's pretty easy to switch iBATIS DAOs to Spring DAOs
  if and when the time is right).  We've made the Java DAO framework permanently available
  on the Java downloads page.  Deprecated basically means we just won't be
  adding any features to it in the future, which is pretty much the same way it's been
  for a couple of years -- I guess it's perfect. ;-)  Kidding.</p>
  <p><b><a href="javadownloads.cgi">The DAO framework will always be available here.</a></b></p>


  <h3>iBATIS for Java 2.2.0 General Availability</h3>
  <p>(December 5, 2006) The votes are in and iBATIS for Java 2.2.0 is promoted
    to general availabilty status.  This release is the most significant release
    of iBATIS in at least a year.  See the
    release notes on the download page for full details.
    This is the last release of iBATIS that will include the DAO framework.</p>
  <p><b><a href="javadownloads.cgi">Download iBATIS 2.2.0!</a></b></p>

  <h3>iBATIS for Java 2.3.0 Released [Status: Beta]</h3>
  <p>(December 1, 2006) This release includes several bug fixes and enhancements.
     Additionally, this release offers new support for local caching of prepared statements.
     Caching prepared statements can lead to significant performance improvements
     in many environments.</p>
  <p>The Java DAO framework has been removed from iBATIS as of release
     2.3.0.  We heartily recommend that you consider using the
     <a href="http://www.springframework.org" target="_blank">Spring Framework</a>
     for all your DAO needs!  Spring offers great support for iBATIS.</p>
  <p>The paginated list methods have been deprecated with this release.  The methods were confusing
     to many users and often misused.  We suggest using native database support for paging,
     or that you use the query methods with skip and max settings.</p>

  <h3>iBATIS.NET DataMapper 1.5.1 and DataAccess 1.8.1 General Availability!</h3>

   iBATIS now supports all essential features of .NET 2.0 (generics, nullable types), see change log for more information.

  <h3>RBatis - iBATIS for Ruby has been released!</h3>
   <p>(Jul 30, 2006) As promised almost exactly one year ago...iBATIS for Ruby is now here. Jon Tirsen
     has joined the team and RBatis is ready to roll with a plug-in for Rails of course. You can see
     the permanent link in the Path to iBATIS on the left, but don't waste time moving your mouse....</p>
  <p><a href="docs/ruby">Check it out!</a></p>

  <h3>DTDs @ iBATIS.com - The Deed has been done</h3>
   <p>(Jul 30, 2006) The DTDs hosted at iBATIS.com have been permanently removed. The multiple warnings
   went starting with a broadcast announcement to the mailing lists and a permanent space on the homepage.
   With over 1.5 million hits to the DTD per month, it was time to move the burden over to the Apache servers.  ;-)
   If you're a year behind on your email and using an old version of iBATIS, and you're wondering why
   your application won't start anymore...try changing the DOCTYPE of your XML files to the following.</p>

  <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE sqlMapConfig <br/>
            PUBLIC "-//ibatis.apache.org//DTD SQL Map Config 2.0//EN" <br/>
            "http://ibatis.apache.org/dtd/sql-map-config-2.dtd"&gt;
  </pre>
  <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE sqlMap <br/>
            PUBLIC "-//ibatis.apache.org//DTD SQL Map 2.0//EN" <br/>
            "http://ibatis.apache.org/dtd/sql-map-2.dtd"&gt;
  </pre>
  <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE daoConfig <br/>
            PUBLIC "-//ibatis.apache.org//DTD DAO Configuration 2.0//EN" <br/>
            "http://ibatis.apache.org/dtd/dao-2.dtd"&gt;
  </pre>

    <p><b>Notice the change to <a href="http://ibatis.apache.org/dtd/">http://ibatis.apache.org/dtd/</a></b></p>
