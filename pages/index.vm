    <h2>What is iBATIS?</h2>

    <p>The iBATIS framework makes it easier to use a database with Java and
    .NET applications. iBATIS couples objects with stored procedures or SQL
    statements using a XML descriptor. Simplicity is the biggest advantage of
    the iBATIS Data Mapper over object relational mapping tools. To use iBATIS
    Data Mapper you rely on your own objects, XML, and SQL. There is little to
    learn that you don't already know. With iBATIS Data Mapper you have the
    full power of both SQL and stored procedures at your fingertips.</p>

    <p>iBATIS is in the process of migrating to the Apache Software
    Foundation. Once we have passed through the Apache Incubator, iBATIS will
    become a top-level Apache project.</p>

    <h3>May 16: iBATIS for Java 2.1.0 Released!</h3>

    <p>This release includes some cool new features like &lt;discriminator&gt;
    and &lt;subMap&gt; tags for better support of class inheritance. There's
    an example of how to use these new tags <a
    href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/ibatis/trunk/java/mapper/mapper2/test/com/ibatis/sqlmap/maps/Documents.xml">here</a>.
    Normally 2.x minor releases are feature releases, but a number of bug
    fixes and improvements have made their way into 2.1.0 as well. <br /><a

    <h3>May 9: New Website</h3>

    <p>Welcome to our new website. It's now more focused on the Apache iBATIS
    tools like Data Mapper and Data Access Objects, and the example Pet Store
    applications. If there's something missing that you found useful before,
    please let us know (see issue tracker to the left). The new site is free
    of tool dependencies and is based on Staticmesh from <a
    href="http://www.pols.co.uk/downloads/static-mesh/">Pols Consulting</a>.
    The idea is to maintain a single site, but we'll likely deploy it to both
    the apache.org site and ibatis.com, or perhaps we'll just forward
    ibatis.com to apache.org. Either way, we'll have one site that is
    maintainable by the whole team. Enjoy.</p>
