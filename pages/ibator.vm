<h2>Introduction to Ibator</h2>

<p>Ibator is a code generator for iBATIS.
 Ibator will introspect a database
 table (or many tables) and will generate iBATIS artifacts that can be used to 
 access the table(s).  This abates some of the initial nuisance of setting up objects and configuration
 files to interact with database tables.  Ibator seeks to make a major impact on the large
 percentage of database operations that are simple CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete).  You will
 still need to hand code SQL and objects for custom queries, or stored procedures.
</p>
<p>Ibator will generate:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SqlMap XML Files</li>
  <li>Java Classes to match the primary key and fields of the table(s)</li>
  <li>DAO Classes that use the above objects (optional)</li>
</ul>

<p>Ibator can run as a standalone JAR file, or as an Ant task, or as an Eclipse plugin.</p>

<h3>About the Name</h3>
<p>Ibator is an iBATIS stylized version of the English word "abator".
 Abator means "one who abates a nuisance".</p>

<h3>Ibator News</h3>
<p>(December 22, 2008) Ibator version 1.2.1 is released.  This version fixes a couple of bugs
 that manifested in the Eclipse plugin, enhances the Plugin API, and adds a couple of features
 to the Eclipse plugin.  Even though this is a relatively minor release, we recommend that
 everyone upgrade.</p>
<p>(December 11, 2008) Ibator version 1.2.0 is released.  This version has several important
 enhancements over Abator 1.1.0.  See the
 <a href="http://ibatis.apache.org/docs/tools/ibator/whatsNew.html">What's New?</a>
 section of the online documentation for full details.  Note that Ibator requires
 Java 5.0 or greater.  The Eclipse plugin requires Eclipse 3.4.1 or greater.  Ibator
 generates code compatible with iBATIS version 2.2.0 or greater.</p>
<p>(April 14, 2008) Due to a trade registration dispute, Abator is renamed to Ibator.
 iBATOR is currently under development.  The initial source code drop can be checked out from SVN 
 at <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ibatis/trunk/java/tools/ibator/" target="_blank">
 http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ibatis/trunk/java/tools/ibator/</a></p>
<p>(March 20, 2008) Updated Abator and the Eclipse plugin to version 1.1.0.  This is an
 extensive update that includes quite a few minor enhancements,
 two major enhancements (two new methods can be generated), and a few bug fixes. 
 See the
 <a href="http://ibatis.apache.org/docs/tools/abator/whatsNew.html">What's New?</a>
 section of the online documentation for full details.</p>
<p>(August 20, 2006) Updated Abator and the Eclipse plugin to version 1.0.0.  This is an
 extensive update that includes many new features including the ability to generate
 code for Java 5, generate different types of domain models, and hugely improved
 "by example" methods.  See the "What's New?" section of the online documentation
 for full details.</p>

<h2>Ibator Software Downloads and Documentation</h2>
<p>Download the standalone JAR if you are using an IDE other than Eclipse.  The
 standalone JAR includes an Ant task to run Ibator, or you can run Ibator from the command
 line of from Java code.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://people.apache.org/builds/ibatis/alpha/ibator-1.2.1-681.zip">
      Ibator 1.2.1 w/Binaries and Source</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Documentation for the core functions of Ibator is available online.  This documentation
 set is also included in the downloads, and is integrated into the Eclipse help system
 if you are using the Eclipse plugin.</p>
<p>Documentation for the Eclipse specific features is integrated into the Eclipse 
 help system and is not available online.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Eclipse Plugin</h2>

<p>When run as an Eclipse plugin, Ibator will persist the generated Java classes and SqlMap files
 in Eclipse projects.  Ibator can be run iteratively multiple time as the database design matures 
 - and any hand coded additions to generated Java classes or SqlMap files will remain undisturbed.</p>

<p>Documentation for Ibator is integrated into the Eclipse help system.</p>
 
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Eclipse 3.4.1 or higher (Note: if you are stuck with prior versions, then the legacy
      Abator code is still available - see below)</li>
  <li>JDK 5.0 or Higher</li>
</ul>
<h3>Automatic Eclipse Install</h3>
<p>If you've already installed a prior version of Ibator, simply run the Eclipse Update
 tool and the new version will be found automatically.</p>
