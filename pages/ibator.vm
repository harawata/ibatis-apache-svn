<h2>Introduction to iBATOR</h2>

<p>iBATOR is a code generator for iBATIS.
 iBATOR will introspect a database
 table (or many tables) and will generate iBATIS artifacts that can be used to 
 access the table(s).  This abates some of the initial nuisance of setting up objects and configuration
 files to interact with database tables.  iBATOR seeks to make a major impact on the large
 percentage of database operations that are simple CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete).  You will
 still need to hand code SQL and objects for custom queries, or stored procedures.
</p>
<p>iBATOR will generate:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SqlMap XML Files</li>
  <li>Java Classes to match the primary key and fields of the table(s)</li>
  <li>DAO Classes that use the above objects (optional)</li>
</ul>

<p>iBATOR can run as a standalone JAR file, or as an Ant task, or as an Eclipse plugin.</p>

<p>iBATOR is currently under development.  The legacy version (Abator) is still available.  If you
 have suggestions for the future of iBATOR, please feel free to send them to the
 Java user's mailing list..</p>

<h3>About the Name</h3>
<p>iBATOR is an iBATIS stylized version of the English word "abator".
 Abator means "one who abates a nuisance".</p>

<h3>iBATOR News</h3>
<p>(April 14, 2008) Due to a trade registration dispute, Abator is renamed to iBATOR.
 iBATOR is currently under development.  The initial source code drop can be checked out from SVN 
 at <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ibatis/trunk/java/tools/ibator/" target="_blank">
 http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ibatis/trunk/java/tools/ibator/</a></p>
<p>(March 20, 2008) Updated Abator and the Eclipse plugin to version 1.1.0.  This is an
 extensive update that includes quite a few minor enhancements,
 two major enhancements (two new methods can be generated), and a few bug fixes. 
 See the
 <a href="http://ibatis.apache.org/docs/tools/abator/whatsNew.html">What's New?</a>
 section of the online documentation for full details.</p>
<p>(August 20, 2006) Updated Abator and the Eclipse plugin to version 1.0.0.  This is an
 extensive update that includes many new features including the ability to generate
 code for Java 5, generate different types of domain models, and hugely improved
 "by example" methods.  See the "What's New?" section of the online documentation
 for full details.</p>

<h2>iBATOR Development</h2>
<p>iBATOR is currently under development.  iBATOR will not be 100% compatible with
 Abator, but will be very close.  Known differences include:
 <ul>
   <li>iBATOR requires JRE version 5.0 or higher</li>
   <li>iBATOR generates code that depends on iBATIS version 2.2.0 or higher</li>
   <li>iBATOR does not include the Legacy generator set from Abator</li>
   <li>The format of the XML configuration file is slightly different and abator* elements
       are renamed to ibator*.</li>
 </ul>
 
 <p>The code generated by iBATOR will be 100% compatible with code generated by
  Abator.  We are simply taking this opportunity to clean up some of the API that
  is a little cumbersome.</p>
 
<h2>Legacy Abator Software Downloads and Documentation</h2>
<p>Download the standalone JAR if you are using an IDE other than Eclipse.  The
 standalone JAR includes an Ant task to run Abator, or you can run Abator from the command
 line of from Java code.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://people.apache.org/builds/ibatis/alpha/abator-1.1.0-426.zip">
      Abator 1.1.0 w/Binaries and Source</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Documentation for the core functions of Abator is available online.  This documentation
 set is also included in the downloads, and is integrated into the Eclipse help system
 if you are using the Eclipse plugin.</p>
<p>Documentation for the Eclipse specific features is integrated into the Eclipse 
 help system and is not available online.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/docs/tools/abator/">Abator Documentation</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Eclipse Plugin</h2>

<p>When run as an Eclipse plugin, Abator will persist the generated Java classes and SqlMap files
 in Eclipse projects.  Abator can be run iteratively multiple time as the database design matures 
- and any hand coded additions to generated Java classes or SqlMap files will remain undisturbed.</p>

<p>Documentation for Abator is integrated into the Eclipse help system.</p>
 
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Eclipse 3.2 or higher (Note: if you are stuck on Eclipse 3.0, or version 6.0
      of the Rational development tools, the prior version of the plugin is still
      available on the update site)</li>
  <li>JDK 1.4 or Higher</li>
</ul>
<h3>Automatic Eclipse Install</h3>
<p>If you've already installed a prior version of Abator, simply run the Eclipse Install/Update
 tool and the new version will be found automatically.</p>
<p>If you've not already installed Abator, then you can use the built in Eclipse 
   install support by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Take the "Help&gt;Software Updates&gt;Find and Install" Menu Option</li>
  <li>Select the "Search for new features to install" radio button, press "Next"</li>
  <li>Press the "New Remote Site" button</li>
  <li>Enter the following information:
    <dl>
      <dt>Name:</dt>
      <dd>Abator for Eclipse Update Site</dd>
      <dt>URL:</dt>
      <dd>http://ibatis.apache.org/tools/abator</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>Press OK</li>
  <li>Check the box next to "Abator for Eclipse Update Site"</li>
  <li>Follow the remainder of the install wizard</li>
</ol>

<h3>Manual Eclipse Install</h3>
<p>The automatic install is much preferred, but you can also install Abator manually if you
 desire. To install manually, download the file
 <a href="http://people.apache.org/builds/ibatis/alpha/AbatorForEclipse1.1.0.zip">AbatorForEclipse1.1.0.zip</a>
 and unzip
 the file to some convenient location.  After unzipping the
 update site archive, follow these steps in Eclipse:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Take the "Help&gt;Software Updates&gt;Find and Install" Menu Option</li>
  <li>Select the "Search for new features to install" radio button, press "Next"</li>
  <li>Press the "New Local Site" button</li>
  <li>Navigate to the location where you unzipped the file.</li>
  <li>Press OK</li>
  <li>Follow the remainder of the install wizard</li>
</ol>
