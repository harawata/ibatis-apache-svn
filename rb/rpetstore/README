== Rails PetStore

This is the demo app for RBatis, the Ruby port of iBatis.

=== Setting up the database

RPetstore is configured out of the box for MySQL. You may need to edit something in 'config/database.yml' for everything to work on your system. To set up the MySQL database issue the following commands:

mysql -u root -e 'create database rpetstore_development'
mysql -u root rpetstore_development -e "source db/mysql/schema.sql"
mysql -u root rpetstore_development -e "source db/mysql/dataload.sql"

If you want to use another database load the equivalent SQL files from the 'db' directory into that database and change 'config/database.yml'.

=== Starting the app

Either use mongrel:

sudo gem install mongrel
mongrel_rails start

Or use built in webrick:

./script/server
