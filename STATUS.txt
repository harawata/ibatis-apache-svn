Board Reports 

July 2005

Since our June report, team iBATIS has rolled a 2.1.5 alpha release of iBATIS for Java and prepared the website to distribute iBATIS GA releases from the ASF mirror network. A PMC member, Clinton Begin, has submitted a proposal for an iBATIS presentation at ApacheCon 2005 US.

June 2005 

The transition from incubator to top-level project goes smoothly. The repository and mailing lists have been rolled over, and the website updated. The last step is to integrate the ASF mirroring with our release process. Our iBATIS.NET product is nearing a GA release, and so we will need to do that soon. We installed a new committer this month, Ron Grabowski.

I have been keeping the PMC updated as to general developments in the LGPL/GPL discussions. Before moving to Apache, iBATIS bundled a Hibernate extension along with the JARs. During incubation, we removed the JARs and substituted stub API files so that our object files compile without the Hibernate library.
