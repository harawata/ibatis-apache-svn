Board Reports 

December 2005 

Since our September Report, iBATIS.NET has posted new distributions of 
our Data Mapper and Data Access products (version 1.3.0 and version 
1.7.0) along with a major update of the Java version of our reference 
applications (v5.0). One of our PMC members, Clinton Begin, presented a 
well-attended talk at ApacheCon US regarding iBATIS. Currently, there are 
implementations of iBATIS for two languages, Java and C#. We were 
following a potential candidate for a Ruby implementation, but that 
process has stalled for the time being. We are now reviewing the work of 
two other developers who are interested in an iBATIS PHP implementation. A
key issue is being able to collaborate with new developers outside of the 
ASF, so that we can determine whether a developer would make a good ASF 
committer.

September 2005 

Since our July report, the iBATIS PMC has nominated four new committers, 
Sven Boden, Jeff Butler, Nathan Maves, and Brice Ruth. Three have 
submitted CLAs that await acknowledgement by the Secretary, and the 
fourth (Brice Ruth) is awaiting creation of his account by root. The 
team is beginning to make plans for a 3.0 release series, which may also 
include implementations for PHP and Ruby.

July 2005

Since our June report, team iBATIS has rolled a 2.1.5 alpha release of 
iBATIS for Java and prepared the website to distribute iBATIS GA releases 
from the ASF mirror network. A PMC member, Clinton Begin, has submitted 
a proposal for an iBATIS presentation at ApacheCon 2005 US.

June 2005 

The transition from incubator to top-level project goes smoothly. The 
repository and mailing lists have been rolled over, and the website 
updated. The last step is to integrate the ASF mirroring with our release 
process. Our iBATIS.NET product is nearing a GA release, and so we will 
need to do that soon. We installed a new committer this month, Ron 
Grabowski.

I have been keeping the PMC updated as to general developments in the 
LGPL/GPL discussions. Before moving to Apache, iBATIS bundled a Hibernate 
extension along with the JARs. During incubation, we removed the JARs and 
substituted stub API files so that our object files compile without the 
Hibernate library.
